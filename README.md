# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Billy!  
Iâ€™m an undergraduate student in the **Department of Electrical Engineering**, currently working in the **Antenna and Electromagnetic Wave Applications Lab**. My research focuses on **antenna design**, **electromagnetic wave applications**, and using **CST** and **MATLAB** for simulations and analysis.

## ðŸ”­ Currently Working On:
- ðŸ“¡ **Designing Microstrip Patch Antennas (MPA) using CST**  
  Iâ€™m in the process of designing efficient MPAs through simulations and analysis to improve antenna performance.
- ðŸ›  **Learning Python and PyTorch**  
  I am currently learning Python and PyTorch in my coursework, focusing on data analysis and algorithm implementation.
- ðŸŒ± **MPA Design in Coursework**  
  As part of my coursework, I am learning to design MPAs using CST and improving my skills in antenna simulation and analysis.
